# Sandbox Page

A place to play around with vanilla JavaScript and CSS Grid/FlexBox.
Also uses 3rd party libraries (marked & YAML for frontmattter)

The goal is to create a static site that loads its navigation and contents from markdown files.


## TODO

- [ ] fetch and parse markdown
- [ ] build navigation
- [ ] load default page (README.md)
- [ ] load other pages
- [ ] sample documents (from Project Gutenburg)
