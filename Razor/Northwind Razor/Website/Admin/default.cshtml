        Admin Page
        <small> Demo forms for CRUD in Razor</small>
    </h1>
    <p>In this demo, we cover how to perform <b>C</b>reate, <b>R</b>ead, <b>U</b>date, and <b>D</b>elete operations on a per-table basis.</p>
    <dl>
        <dt><a href="~/Admin/SearchProductByCategory.cshtml">Search Products by Category</a></dt>
        <dd>This page demos looking up data from the database and displaying the contents in a WebGrid. It includes customizing the WebGrid to generate links for each product that go to the <b>Manage Products</b> page passing the product id as a query string.</dd>

        <dt><a href="~/Admin/SearchProductBySupplier.cshtml">Search Products by Supplier</a></dt>
        <dd>This is similar to the <b>Search Products by Category</b> page and is left for the student to generate. The SQL query to get the suppliers is <code>SELECT SupplierID, CompanyName FROM Suppliers ORDER BY CompanyName</code> and the SQL to get the products is <code>SELECT ProductID, ProductName, QuantityPerUnit, UnitPrice, UnitsInStock FROM Products WHERE SupplierID = @@0</code></dd>

        <dt><a href="~/Admin/SearchProductByProductName.cshtml">Search Products by Partial Product name</a></dt>
        <dd>In this demo, we will see how to properly include SQL wildcards in a search within Razor.</dd>

        <dt><a href="~/Admin/ManageProducts.cshtml">Manage Products</a></dt>
        <dd>This is a "catch-all" page that performs all CRUD operations on the Products (including handling query string page-redirects from other pages).</dd>

        <dt><a href="~/Admin/ManageCategories.cshtml">Manage Categories</a></dt>
        <dd>In this sample, we see a CRUD page that manages categories, including handling the display of images from the database and uploading images.</dd>

        <dt><a href="~/Admin/ManageSuppliers.cshtml">Manage Suppliers</a></dt>
        <dd>In this sample, the Suppliers are maintained in a simple CRUD form.</dd>
